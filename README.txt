basically im Alex Haley, independent developer and researcher.

i work on making good modern software core written in low level 
programming rather than using high level abstraction so it would 
not be slow as all of our modern software now.

right now there is no big projects released, may be when its ready.

//
// software configs:
//

// os: gnu/linux arch + windows 11 (now i need this a little bit)
// fs(linux specific): btrfs
// editor: emacs, 4coder (also trying focus, but its not that completed as emacs or 4coder, lacking their features)
// terminal: kitty, terminator, windows terminal (still using windows now)
// shell: bash
// wm: i3wm on xorg with raw bumblebee-status, no themes, just black screens..
// font: currently FiraCode Mono Medium, also was using Hack Mono Medium, ProFont IIx pretty cool though
