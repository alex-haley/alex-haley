basically im Alex Haley, independent developer and researcher.

my main goal is to write reliable software with low-level approach
and to develop my own tools for everyday work

right now there is no big projects released, may be when its ready.

//
// software configs:
//

// os: gnu/linux arch + windows 11 (still using windows for now)
// fs(linux specific): btrfs
// editor: emacs, 4coder (also trying focus, but its not that complete as emacs or 4coder, lacking their features)
// i use that many editors because of the different languages that i use and different approaches for editing
// terminal: kitty, terminator, windows terminal
// shell: bash
// wm: i3wm on xorg with raw bumblebee-status, no themes, just black screens.. 
// for normal desktop environment i usually use kde-plasma
// font: currently FiraCode Mono Medium, also was using Hack Mono Medium, ProFont IIx pretty cool though
